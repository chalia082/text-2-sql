    "#### Explanation of Key Components\n",
    "1. Reading Data from PostgreSQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The fetch_table_data method retrieves all rows from a specified table.\n",
    "* The get_table_schema and classify_columns methods dynamically analyze the schema to identify textual columns for embedding, excluding IDs and non-semantic fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic Embedding Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fixed embedding model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is used to ensure consistency since users cannot specify a model.\n",
    "* Textual columns are concatenated into a single string per row (combined_text) for embedding, ensuring adaptability to varying schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Storage Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Embeddings are stored in separate tables (e.g., customers_embeddings) for each source table, linked by original_id to the original data.\n",
    "* Metadata (non-embedded fields like IDs, numeric data) is stored as JSONB for flexible retrieval.\n",
    "* An IVFFlat index is created on the embedding column for efficient similarity searches, as recommended in the search results .\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Answering Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The similarity_search method embeds the user query using the same model and performs a cosine similarity search using pgvectorâ€™s <=> operator, converting distance to similarity (1 - distance) as shown in search results .\n",
    "* Results include the original ID, content, metadata, and similarity score, allowing for detailed responses or further filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Features and Adaptations\n",
    "* Schema Adaptability: The system automatically detects and processes relevant columns, making it suitable for tables with varying schemas.\n",
    "* Performance Optimization: Separate embedding tables and indexing (IVFFlat) ensure efficient storage and retrieval, as highlighted in search results .\n",
    "* Scalability: Batch processing and connection management are implemented to handle large datasets, with potential for further optimization using batch inserts or COPY as suggested in search result "
