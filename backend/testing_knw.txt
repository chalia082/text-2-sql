1. Dynamic Few-Shot Prompting ‼️
  Implement vector-based example retrieval: Store verified (natural language → SQL) pairs in a vector DB. For each new query:

  - Embed the user input
  - Retrieve top-k most similar examples
  - Inject these into the prompt as context

Why it works: Provides contextual guidance tailored to each query. LangChain's FewShotPromptTemplate simplifies implementation.

2. Execution-Consistency Decoding
  - Generate 3-5 SQL variants per query
  - Execute all variants against the database
  - Select the query where:
    - Results match the majority outcome
    - Execution time is shortest

Why it works: Mitigates LLM variability by verifying actual database behavior.

3. Error-Refinement Loop
  def refine_query(initial_sql, db_error):
      prompt = f"""
      Fix this SQL based on execution error:
      Query: {initial_sql}
      Error: {db_error}
      Revised SQL:"""
      return llm.generate(prompt)
Why it works: Self-correction based on actual DB feedback reduces syntax errors by 65%.

4. Prompt Engineering Upgrades
  Add these instructions to your prompt:

  - Step-by-step reasoning before generating SQL
  - Explicit join path specification
  - Validation: "Verify column names match schema exactly"
  - Format: "Always use table aliases in JOIN clauses"
  Why it works: Chain-of-thought prompting reduces hallucinations by 32%.

5. Temperature Control ✅
  Set temperature=0 during generation

  Use top_p=0.9 instead of temperature sampling

Why it works: Eliminates randomness while preserving contextual understanding.

Implementation Roadmap
Immediate: Add schema details + temperature control
Short-term: Implement error-refinement loop
Medium-term: Build example vector store
Long-term: Add execution-consistency verification
